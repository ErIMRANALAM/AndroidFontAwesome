# AndroidFontAwesome
<hr/>
Font Awesome is very popular icon toolkit used across many websites. It has both free and pro collection of icons, but you can find most the icons in free collection itself. Each icon will represented by unicode (&#xf17b;). We use this unicode to display the icon in TextView. As itâ€™s a normal TextView, all the text styling attributes (color, size, paddings etc.,) can be applied.

For an example if you want to display android Robot logo, you can use &#xf17b; unicode as TextView value.
